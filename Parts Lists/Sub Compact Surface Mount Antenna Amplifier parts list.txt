Parts list - Antenna Amplifiers

Ultra Compact (surface mount) Antenna Amplifier board (can fit inside the official Pi Zero GPIO case):

Required:
2 x 100R 1206 surface mount 0.25W resistors (eg: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/264316275840 for all resistor values)
1 x 4.7K 1206 surface mount 0.25W resistor
1 x 200R 1206 surface mount 0.25W resistor
1 x 2N3904 SOT23 surface mount tansistor (eg: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/264354670177)
Minimum of 12 pin or breakaway / cut back female header or 2 x 6 pin female header (these work for this purpose: https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B088PWBVFL)
Some wire for general configuration.
An antenna - could be wire or a tuned ferrite. See below.
Some insulating tape for the underside so as to not short on the Pi's microSD card holder.

Optional:
1 x 1nF surface mount capacitor (eg https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/264566930175)
1 x small 3 pin THT SPDT switch or a wire link (eg https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274395236531) to select the VCC supply voltage, or header pins and jumper link
1 x Tuned ferrite antenna for your region (eg https://www.universal-solder.ca/product/60khz-fine-tuned-loop-stick-antenna-for-atomic-clock-receiver/  or  https://www.universal-solder.ca/product/77-5khz-fine-tuned-loop-stick-antenna-for-dcf77-receiver/)


Notes:
1. The amplifier will not work until the VCC has been set (either 3V3 or 5V).
This can be done with a wire link, header pins and a jumper link or a switch,
depending on how often you are likely to change it. Please note that if you
plan on installing this in a case you will most likely have to use a wire link
due to the height of a switch or the header pins.

2. The shutdown button is entirely optional however if fitted this may prevent
the board from fitting inside of a case due to the height. You can of course
solder wires to the PCB and take it to a button of your choice and fix this
outside of the case or not bother with it at all. I liked it, but hey.

3. The 1nF capacitor is not required when using a pre-tuned (ferrite) antenna
or a simple coil of wire. If not used the capacitor must be replaced with a
wire link or a zero ohm resistor (or even a solder blob). The purpose of this
capacitor was to tune the ferrite that Andreas Spiess made (see his video) and
will be included in a pre-tuned ferrite and is not required at all if just
using several turns of wire in open air.

4. Ferrite antennas can be highly effective in low power applications such as
this however they should be tuned to your requirement. If you wish to buy a
pre-tuned ferrite I suggest those from Universal Solder.

For MSF (UK), WWVB (United States) and JJY-60 (Japan) use the 60Khz antenna:

For DCF77 (Germany) use the 77.5Khz antenna:
