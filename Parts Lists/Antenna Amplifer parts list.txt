Parts list - Antenna Amplifiers

Standard Antenna Amplifier board (full Pi Zero style footprint):

Required:
2 x 100R 0.25W resistors (eg: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/263898843941 for all resistor values)
1 x 4.7K 0.25W resistor
1 x 200R 0.25W resistor
1 x 2N3904 T092 tansistor (eg: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/263708027071)
40 pin female header (eg: https://thepihut.com/products/gpio-header-for-raspberry-pi-a-b-pi-2-pi-3-pi-4-zero)
Some wire for general configuration.
An antenna - could be wire or a tuned ferrite. See below.

Optional:
1 x 1nF ceramic disc capacitor (eg https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/263699742253)
1 x small 3 pin THT SPDT switch or a wire link (eg https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274395236531) to select the VCC supply voltage, or header pins and jumper link
1 x 6x3x5mm push button (eg https://thepihut.com/products/tactile-switch-buttons-6mm-slim-x-20-pack) for the "Shutdown" feature
1 x Tuned ferrite antenna for your region (eg https://www.universal-solder.ca/product/60khz-fine-tuned-loop-stick-antenna-for-atomic-clock-receiver/  or  https://www.universal-solder.ca/product/77-5khz-fine-tuned-loop-stick-antenna-for-dcf77-receiver/)
Cable ties and bases to secure your chosen antenna.


Notes:
1. The amplifier will not work until the VCC has been set (either 3V3 or 5V).
This can be done with a wire link, header pins and a jumper link or a switch,
depending on how often you are likely to change it. Please note that if you
plan on installing this in a case you will most likely have to use a wire link
due to the height of a switch or the header pins.

2. The shutdown button is entirely optional however if fitted this may prevent
the board from fitting inside of a case due to the height. You can of course
solder wires to the PCB and take it to a button of your choice and fix this
outside of the case or not bother with it at all. I liked it, but hey.

3. The 1nF capacitor is not required when using a pre-tuned (ferrite) antenna
or a simple coil of wire. If not used the capacitor must be replaced with a
wire link. The purpose of this capacitor was to tune the ferrite that Andreas
Spiess made (see his video) and will be included in a pre-tuned ferrite and is
not required at all if just using several turns of wire in open air.

4. Ferrite antennas can be highly effective in low power applications such as
this however they should be tuned to your requirement. If you wish to buy a
pre-tuned ferrite I suggest those from Universal Solder.

For MSF (UK), WWVB (United States) and JJY-60 (Japan) use the 60Khz antenna:

For DCF77 (Germany) use the 77.5Khz antenna:

5. If fitting into a case the capacitor (if fitted) and transistor should have
their leads bent flat to the PCB in order to reduce their height.
